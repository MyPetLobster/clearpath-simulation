# ClearPath Traffic Safety Systems Simulation

Simulation of ClearPath's Traffic Safety Systems, including the Emergency Traffic System (ETS) and the Pursuit 
Activated Traffic System (PATS).

## Background

ClearPath aims to enhance public safety by automatically converting traffic signals into 4-way blinking red stop lights in the path of emergency vehicles and police pursuits, reducing the risk of intersection accidents. 

The systems will utilize real-time GPS data from emergency vehicles, traffic signal status from city management systems, and voice inputs from dispatchers to continuously track vehicle locations and predict their paths. AI will monitor dispatch communications for critical updates and extend the safety zone to include schools and public events when necessary. 

By automating these safety measures, ClearPath PATS seeks to create a safer environment for both responders and the public, minimizing accidents and ensuring efficient emergency responses. This project will demonstrate the system's basic functionality through a Python simulation, providing a foundation for real-world application and highlighting the system's potential benefits.


### About this project

This is my final project for Sophia.org's Introduction to Python Programming. I've had this idea for ClearPath for a while now, 
and just recently started taking notes and planning out the project. Prior to beginning this course, I already had some prior 
experience with Python. So instead of doing the bare minimum for this final project, I decided to actually build something that
will help me toward building a prototype for ClearPath. 

I decided to focus on creating a basic simulation of ClearPath's Traffic Safety Systems for this project. I intend to use pygame and geopy libraries to create a visual simulation of the system in action.
